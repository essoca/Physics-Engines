# Physics-Engines
This contains some basic Physics simulations using Python and Pygame (the latter for visualizing). The simulated topics:

- **Pygame basics**: These are a set of very simple Python scripts to introduce Pygame capabilities. For more on this, go to the [official documents](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)

- **Vectors**: a Python script is provided which simulates the graphical addition of vectors. Details can be found in the markdown file.

- **Equilibrium of forces**: a Python script is provided which simulates a block hanging from two knotted strings. For certain angles for the strings and weigth of the block, the string breaks and the block falls. Details can be found in the markdown file.

- **Projectile motion**: a Python script is provided which simulates scoring a basketball. Air drag can also be added to the simulation. Details can be found in the markdown file.

- **Ideal gas**: a Python script is provided which simulates Boyle's law microscopically by compressing a bunch of noninteracting particles. Details can be found in the markdown file.
